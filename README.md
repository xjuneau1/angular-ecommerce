# Angular E-Commerce Store

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.1.
Created by following the tutorial at [freeCodeCamp YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbauf9IgsC4)

## Starting the application

In order to start the application, open your CLI and navigate to the ```src``` folder. Run the command ```ng serve``` and it will start the server for the Store page.

To use the Stripe service you will need to run the server that supplies the Stripe service to the UI. In order to do this open the server folder in your CLI and run the command ```node server.js```, it should display a message indicating that the server is running on port 4242.

## Notes

While I followed this project step by step, there were many implementations that needed to be changed to work with Angular 15, as the tutorial used an outdated version of Angular.
